<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ratatouille is a traditional French Proven√ßal stewed vegetable dish, originating from Nice. The key ingredients include eggplant, bell peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs such as thyme and basil. The vegetables are typically cooked separately and then combined and stewed together in olive oil, allowing each ingredient to retain its unique flavor and texture. Ratatouille can be served as a side dish or a main course, either hot or cold, and is often accompanied by crusty bread. The dish gained international fame from the animated film of the same name, which showcased a refined, elegantly plated version of the rustic classic.</p>
